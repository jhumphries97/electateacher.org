<p style="text-align: left;">Many people move to Santa Rosa County because of the excellent schools and beautiful beaches. We are fortunate to serve some of the best students and families in the nation. However, there is a threat to our quality way of life. We are currently facing mounting challenges that must be addressed swiftly and comprehensively.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, for the past four years test scores have declined. We must reverse this trend and propel SRC back to the top. We are also facing rising school safety and security issues, budget challenges, a struggle to recruit and retain quality teachers, and massive population growth,  creating overcrowding and additional safety and security issues in our schools.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most of this issues are related, but require distinct intentional responses, beginning with an admission that there is work to be done. First, we cannot continue to make poor financial decisions like selling the old Munson School at a $1,650,000 loss, especially when we have so many needs to be addressed, and places we could put that money to use.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We need experienced leaders in education with innovative ideas and the courage and grit to see Santa Rosa County School District move forward in excellence. Vigilance is required in order for our children to be provided a world-class education and Santa Rosa County to remain among Florida’s finest.</p>

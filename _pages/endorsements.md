<h3>5th grade teacher at WNIS</h3>
<blockquote>We have worked together as colleagues for 9 years.

Kenny is an amazing educator, leader, and family man. He has great insight, charisma, and inspires both students and teachers to do their best in all aspects. He will be an asset to SRCSB. The best part about Kenny is that he doesn’t shy away from the hard questions. He takes the time to do research and comes from a place of knowledge and facts. He will help get Santa Rosa county back to the top with fresh insight, passion, and dedication. Go Kenny!</blockquote>

<h3>Physical Therapist</h3>
<blockquote>My name is Julie Walsh, I am a physical therapist in Gulf Breeze who has lived in this area for over 20 years, and have 2 children in the SRC school system currently.   I would like to take this opportunity to give my endorsement to Kenny Long for Santa Rosa County School Board District 3.

Kenny has taught both of my children while teaching at West Navarre Intermediate School.  He taught my son in 4th grade, and my daughter all three years in her gifted curriculum. I have volunteered in his classroom and have witnessed what a amazing educator he is first hand.  He truly has instilled in his students a passion for learning, and an eagerness to dig deeper in the learning process.

Kenny is also a father to 5 kids who are in our school system and understands not only  keeping the level of education we have in this area, but making it better.  We need to be able to continue to draw quality educators to our system.  He has my family's vote and is the best man for the job.</blockquote>
